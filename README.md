# Guessing Game
The time I wrote this I was taking one of those 'Learn Front-End WebDev'
courses through Udacity, Rob Percival I beleive was the instructor.
At any rate, this is a superbly stuperfluous app.  On the other hand,
I really do like keeping things like this around for posterity.

## To Do:
 - Create new branch for old code.
 - Update and modularize with my favorite front-end stack (webpack/react/sass)
 - Maybe add some flair?
